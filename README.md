# grf
This is a project on the generation of stationary Gaussian random vector fields which I did for a seminar 
on theoretical and computational plasma physics and fluid dynamics during the winter term 2018/2019.
The src folder contains the necessary python files to generate realizations of GRFs in one, two or three dimensions with a stationary, 
isotropic and solenoidal correlation matrix, as well as a simple application to direct simulations of the 1d KPZ equation.
A more or less detailed introduction to the topic is given in the presentation slides.
The Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum beamer template which I used may be found [here](https://github.com/sjewo/rub-beamer).
You can contact me via timo.schorlepp [ad] rub.de if you have questions on this project or want to discuss something.
